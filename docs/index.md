# Portfolio

## Week2 

I learned VSCode tutorial. I have a basic understanding of the working principles. I installed the visual studio code on my computer and strated writing html code. 
I went through the web tutorial and got to know how to create a website by html.
I created my first website based on the lecture and tutorials using VSCode [my first website](https://lfeitong.github.io/Week2-Web).


## Week3

- I started to try to build something really meaningful on my own website and add typography to the website. I went to talk with my TA and she gave me some very helpful information. Through this [link](https://marksheet.io/css-basics.html), I learned how to use html to build the hierarchy of the website and use css to set the style of the web page (including colors, fonts and pictures). I also found useful information and exercises on this [website](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp).
- According to Dr.Bart's lecture, I created a react app [here](https://lfeitong.github.io/feitong-app/).
- I leanred how to deploy my react app to github pages (according to [this](https://dev.to/yuribenjamin/how-to-deploy-react-app-in-github-pages-2a1f)),and how to set up the workflow on github actions(according to [this](https://dev.to/dyarleniber/setting-up-a-ci-cd-workflow-on-github-actions-for-a-react-app-with-github-pages-and-codecov-4hnp)).


## Week4
- I watched the YouTube by Dr.Bart, and I created a simple app based on the content in the video [here](http://localhost:3000/feitong-app)
- I haven't had time to enrich this app yet, but I'd like to make it serve different recipes just like the website I created earlier.
- I've never leanred TypeScript or JavaScript before, so I spend several days this week read related materials and tutorials. Now I can use them in my React app development.( These are the websites that have been very helpful to me: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html),[JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript))
- I spent most of my time creating a shopping cart site based on this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfmL6bGbiN8).
- I went through the bootstrap [tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap5/), it helped me to set up the layout, colors, buttons on my react app. I set up the bootstrap on react by [this](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/).
- This week I focused on react development, and these are the sites where I learned how to use React. ([React Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke90Tje7VS0),[React JS Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTeuhbP7wdE))

## Week5
- I was having trouble posting my React app on public website after pushing on github. I talked to Dr.Bart and my TA Lauren about my deploy problem, and watched the video by josh. Finally, the problem was solved and my app was successfully deployed. The deploy code are from [here](https://dev.to/yuribenjamin/how-to-deploy-react-app-in-github-pages-2a1f).
- I spent a lot of time refining my website this week. My web is about food and recipes, and my CSS code mainly refers to this [site](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp), about images, format, and fonts. I found the site very useful, mainly because I could change the source code in the try  me and see if the output is what I wanted. So I don't mess with my original code. 
- I also use this [site](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/Web/CSS/background-image) when I have problems with images.
- I also completed my react app this week, by adding style TypeScript files on each sections. I also fixed some bugs such as overlapping images and failure to add items to the shopping cart.
- In order to better use JavaScript and TypeScript in the app, I watched the videos saved in the list last week.([JavaScript Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdI2bqOjy3c),[JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv_5Zv5c-Ts),[TypeScript - The Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahCwqrYpIuM))
- In addition, I added the test part in my app, which I learned from the lectures and online resources. I followed this [instruction](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/running-tests/) on setiing and debugging testI learned [unit testing with Jest](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-CS5500-Spring-2021/tutorials/week5-unit-testing), [Testing React App](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/06/practical-guide-testing-react-applications-jest/), [Video on testing in React](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Q7ss7wvoo).
- It's incredible that in the past few weeks I've mostly learned the basic use of HTML, CSS, JS, TS by myself and built my app and website. I found it important to learn how to Google, and now when I have a problem in coding I can quickly find helpful resource through Google and know which part I can use for reference.

# TODO 

## Week2

- make my website cooler
- try to add other link in my website and change format


## Week3

- I have went through the part of HTML and CSS in this [link](https://sun.iwu.edu/~mliffito/cs_codex/posts/web-development-basics/), and I'm going to through javascript and Flask next week.
- I would focus on javascript accoring to [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).  There are tutorials for programmers at several levels of experience.
- For Flask,I'll read [it](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) and get to know what it means and how it works, and try to do some practice by myself.
- For my website, it's still very basic now, so I'm going to set a main menu, link the name of foos to it's recipes, and figure out how to modify image (like change the size or set it as background). This is a [website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes) might be helpful.
- For my app, I just created a welcome page and haven't fully understand how to make it have some functions. So I'm going to add buttons and content, hopefully the page changes when the user clicks the button or inserts some text. Based on this, rewatch Dr. Bart's lecture record would be helpful, and I'll look for other related resources if needed.


## Week4
- I'd like to explore how to implement a better user interface, because my interface is still a bit cluttered now. (This is an [instruction](https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/user-interface-design.html) on it)
- I only learned test in class this week and didn't have time to add the test part in React.
- So next week I will definitely try to add test to my app and improve coverage. ([Jest test](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-CS5500-Spring-2021/tutorials/week5-unit-testing (Links to an external site.)[Jest&React](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/06/practical-guide-testing-react-applications-jest/))
- My app seems only work in local host, so I think I didn't set up the workflow correctly. I'm going to check it out and seek help from instructor or ta if it still doesn't work out.
- I'm going to check more tutorials on JavaScript and TypeScript, since I'm still confused sometimes. (I found some Youtube videos that might help: [JavaScript Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdI2bqOjy3c),[JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv_5Zv5c-Ts),[TypeScript - The Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahCwqrYpIuM))
