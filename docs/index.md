## Week2 

I learned VSCode tutorial. I have a basic understanding of the working principles. I installed the visual studio code on my computer and strated writing html code. 
I went through the web tutorial and got to know how to create a website by html.
I created my first website based on the lecture and tutorials using VSCode [my first website](https://lfeitong.github.io/Week2-Web).


## Week3

I started to try to build something really meaningful on my own website and add typography to the website. I went to talk with my ta and she gave me some very helpful information. Through this [link](https://marksheet.io/css-basics.html), I learned how to use html to build the hierarchy of the website and use css to set the style of the web page (including colors, fonts and pictures). I also found useful information and exercises on this [website](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp).
According to Dr.Bart's lecture, I created a react app [here].
