# Portfolio

## Week2 

I learned VSCode tutorial. I have a basic understanding of the working principles. I installed the visual studio code on my computer and strated writing html code. 
I went through the web tutorial and got to know how to create a website by html.
I created my first website based on the lecture and tutorials using VSCode [my first website](https://lfeitong.github.io/Week2-Web).


## Week3

- I started to try to build something really meaningful on my own website and add typography to the website. I went to talk with my TA and she gave me some very helpful information. Through this [link](https://marksheet.io/css-basics.html), I learned how to use html to build the hierarchy of the website and use css to set the style of the web page (including colors, fonts and pictures). I also found useful information and exercises on this [website](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp).
- According to Dr.Bart's lecture, I created a react app [here](https://lfeitong.github.io/feitong-app/).
- I leanred how to deploy my react app to github pages (according to [this](https://dev.to/yuribenjamin/how-to-deploy-react-app-in-github-pages-2a1f)),and how to set up the workflow on github actions(according to [this](https://dev.to/dyarleniber/setting-up-a-ci-cd-workflow-on-github-actions-for-a-react-app-with-github-pages-and-codecov-4hnp)).

# TODO 

## Week2

- make my website cooler
- try to add other link in my website and change format


## Week3

- I have went through the part of HTML and CSS in this [link](https://sun.iwu.edu/~mliffito/cs_codex/posts/web-development-basics/), and I'm going to through javascript and Flask next week.
- I would focus on javascript accoring to [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).  There are tutorials for programmers at several levels of experience.
- For Flask,I'll read [it](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) and get to know what it means and how it works, and try to do some practice by myself.
- For my website, it's still very basic now, so I'm going to set a main menu, link the name of foos to it's recipes, and figure out how to modify image (like change the size or set it as background). This is a [website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes) might be helpful.
- For my app, I just created a welcome page and haven't fully understand how to make it have some functions. So I'm going to add buttons and content, hopefully the page changes when the user clicks the button or inserts some text. Based on this, rewatch Dr. Bart's lecture record would be helpful, and I'll look for other related resources if needed.
